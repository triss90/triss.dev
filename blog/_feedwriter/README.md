# Generate **RSS 1.0**, **RSS 2.0** or **ATOM** Formatted Feeds

This package can be used to generate feeds in either **RSS 1.0**, **RSS 2.0** or **ATOM** format.

Applications can create a feed object, several feed item objects, set several types of properties of either feed and feed items, and add items to the feed.

Once a feed is fully composed with its items, the feed class can generate the necessary XML structure to describe the feed in **RSS** or **ATOM** format. This structure can be directly sent to the browser, or just returned as string.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.3 or higher

If you don't have **PHP 5.3** available on your system there is a version supporting **PHP 5.0** and above. See the `legacy-php-5.0` branch.

## Documentation

The documentation can be found in the `gh-pages` branch, or on [GitHub Pages](https://mibe.github.io/FeedWriter/).

See the `/examples` directory for usage examples.

See the `CHANGELOG.md` file for changes between the different versions.
