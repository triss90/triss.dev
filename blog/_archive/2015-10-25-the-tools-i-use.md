# The Tools I Use
_2015-10-25_
<hr>

This article is a brief overview of the tools i use personally and professionally when designing and coding websites and apps.

<h1>Design</h1>
I don't do a lot of standalone design work. Granted the vast majority of the work I take on, does require some form of design, usually done by me. I'm on MAC and have chosen my software-suit accordingly.

<div class="row" style="background:#ffffff">
   <div class="medium-6" style="padding: 30px;">
      <h3><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/sketch-icon.png" height="24px" alt="Sketch"> Sketch</h3>
      <p>Sketch is a MAC only app. I mainly use Sketch to mock up designs, create vector images and icons. It has completely replaced Adobe Illustrator for me. Not only is it an amazing tool to design with. It's also a lot cheaper than Adobe's alternative.</p>

      <h3><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/pixelmator-icon.png" height="30px" alt="Pixelmator"> Pixelmator</h3>
      <p>Pixelmator is another exclusive MAC app. It's powerful, fast, and easy to use. I've completely switched over from using photoshop, and now exclusively use Pixelmator to process and edit my images.</p>

      <h3><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/tinypng-icon.png" height="24px" alt="TinyPNG"> TinyPNG</h3>
      <p>TinyPNG is a smart web-based tool that uses smart compression to reduce the file size of image files. It does so, by reducing the number of colors in a given image. The effect is almost always completely invisible, and usually reduces the file size by 50-70%. I never publish an image before running it through TinyPNG.</p>

      <h3><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/atom-icon.png" height="24px" alt="Atom"> Atom</h3>
      <p>Atom is a text editor developed by the Github-team and thus it has great implementation with Github. It's leightweight and hackable. It's a got a growing community and a tons of plugins. In short, it's slowly becoming my favorite text editor. I find myself using it for more and more projects.</p>

      <p>Sublime Text is still my go to editor. It's lightness paired with it's speed and customizability makes it an absolute breeze to work with. In my opinion, the best editor available.</p>

      <p>I manage a few sites for a couple of my clients. Now and then they need a few lines of text updated on a static page. Coda allows me to edit the html files directly on the server. It's quick and dirty, and I like it.</p>

      <h3><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/screenflow-icon.png" height="24px" alt="Screenflow"> Screenflow</h3>
      <p>I record all my videos with Screenflow. Although I must admit I'm no expert on the field I've found it simple and easy to use. I suppose it does lack some functionality that I'm sure other apps include. Nevertheless, it suits my needs just fine.</p>
