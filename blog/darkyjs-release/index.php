<h1>Darky.js Release</h1>
<p class='timestamp'><time datetime='2023-07-28'>2023-07-28</time></p><hr>
<p>After a lot of hard work and dedication, I'm pleased to present a new JavaScript library that enables dark mode on any website without any hassle or need to rework the existing codebase.</p>
<p><strong>Darky.js</strong> is a simple yet powerful tool that gives developers the capability to switch to a dark theme with just a few lines of code. It offers various customization options, making it adaptable to your design needs. Darky.js has been created with user experience in mind, making it a breeze to switch between light and dark themes.</p>

<h2>Key features of Darky.js:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Easy Integration: It's as simple as embedding a JS file. No need to rewrite or redesign your existing codebase.</li>
<li>Customizable: The library provides various customization options for the dark mode button and background.</li>
<li>Save in Cookies: Option to save user's theme preference using cookies.</li>
<li>Auto Match OS Theme: Darky.js can automatically match the OS's color scheme preference.</li>
<li>Callbacks: It provides an optional callback function onChange that is triggered when the dark mode is toggled.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Darky.js, your website can now be friendlier to users' eyes during night-time browsing or for those who simply prefer darker themes. I encourage you to give it a try and look forward to seeing all the amazing things you will do with it.</p>
<p>I am eager to see your feedback and how I can improve Darky.js for you. Let's make the web a darker place together! Happy coding! 💻🌙</p>
