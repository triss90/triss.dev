<hr>
<p>Writing proper and thorough alternative text (alt-text) for images on the web,
is not just important. It is vital for those who depend on screen readers for
navigating the web.</p>
<p>In spite of this, many publishers continue to include useless text
or neglect the alt-text entirely.</p>
<h2>So, how do you do it?</h2>
<p>Writing proper alt-text is, at its core, very simple. All you need to do,
is describe the image. E.g.: ‚ÄúGroup of people on a train station.‚Äù.</p>
<p>A few things to avoid would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Including the name of the photographer</li>
<li>Adding keywords for search engine optimization.</li>
<li>Saying &quot;Image of&quot; or &quot;Photo of&quot;.</li>
</ul>
