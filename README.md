# About Tristan White

Today I co-own and work at ServicePoint A/S, primarily focusing on developing and mainting cloud infrastructure at <a href="https://cloudservers.dk" target="_blank">cloudservers.dk</a> and building management development at <a href="https://flowsense.dk" target="_blank">flowsense.dk</a>.

Building the right foundation to ongoing optimization and support. In short, I try to make the web a better place.

I have worked with corporations, institutions and startups in a wide range of industries, spanning a number of European countries.
