I learned a humbling lesson last week. For a long time, my focus was on technology. It made sense to me—if you build the best product, if your technical solutions are flawless, surely the business will follow. Surely, people will see the value, recognize the craft, and come knocking on the door.

But I was wrong.

It took a fresh perspective, a frank conversation, and a moment of genuine humility to see the truth: technology is only one part of the puzzle. Our company, like any company, is nothing without meaningful relationships—with our partners, our customers, and the community around us.

This realization didn’t come easily. I had always believed that the technical side was where my value lay. I was comfortable there, confident in my skills, and I thought that if I focused on building the best systems, the rest would naturally follow. But in reality, I was missing out on the bigger picture. It wasn’t enough to just create great products—I needed to engage with people, understand their needs, and make them a part of the journey.

Success is not built in a vacuum. It’s built by fostering relationships, understanding needs, and creating a genuine connection with those around us. You can build the most elegant, efficient system, but if no one knows or trusts you, it doesn’t matter.

For a new company, this means putting in the work to not just develop technology but to actively reach out and create new opportunities. It means stepping out of the comfort zone of development and talking to people—listening, learning, and being genuinely interested in their stories and challenges.

Meaningful relationships don’t just happen; they require effort, intention, and openness. I had to confront my own assumptions about what it means to be successful. It’s not just about being technically proficient or having the best product—it’s about understanding the people who use your products, the people who support your business, and the people who believe in your vision.

I now see that the true value of what we do isn’t just in the technology we create, but in the connections we forge, the trust we build, and the community we foster.

We’re not just here to revolutionize how people interact with spaces or how buildings interact with our environment. We’re here to collaborate, to inspire, and to learn from others. That’s why I’m not just open to new connections—I’m actively seeking them out.

If you are someone who’s passionate about smart buildings, innovative technology, and making our environments more intuitive and sustainable—or if you simply want to share ideas—I’d love to hear from you. Let's build something meaningful together.
