# Aspect Ratio Revisited

Back in 2019 I wrote a short post about [Maintaining Aspect Ratio](https://triss.dev/blog/2019/06/07/maintaining-aspect-ration/) with CSS.

The example I gave, took advantage of what is called the "padding-hack",
which works by setting the `height` of an element to 0 and the `padding-top`
to the percentage that represents the relation between width and height, i.e. the aspect ratio.

To maintain an aspect ratio of 9:16 you would be setting the `padding-top` to 56.25% like so:

```
.element {
  width: 100%;
  background-image: url('https://webbox.dev/placeholder/image.php?width=533&height=300&text=placeholder&textColor=162,252,162&backgroundColor=34,34,34');
  background-size: cover;

  /* Aspect Ratio */
  height: 0;
  padding-top: 56.25%
}
```

**Result:**

<small>Resize window to see the effect of the applied aspect ratio</small>

<div class="example example-1"></div>

To calculate the percentage of your aspect ratio, simply divide the dimensions like so: ( 9 / 16 ) Ã— 100 = <span class=result>56.25%</span>.

## So what's new?

In the time since I posted this "hack", the CSS property `aspect-ratio` has gained full support in all major browsers,
so we now have a much better way of defining aspect ratio.

Using the CSS property `aspect-ratio` removes all the guesswork and calculations required.
You simply need to define your preferred aspect ratio like so:

```
.element {
  width: 100%;
  background-image: url('https://webbox.dev/placeholder/image.php?width=533&height=300&text=placeholder&textColor=162,252,162&backgroundColor=34,34,34');
  background-size: cover;

  /* Aspect Ratio */
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
}
```

**Result:**

<small>Resize window to see the effect of the applied aspect ratio</small>

<div class="example example-2"></div>

Note that whenever you want to use `aspect-ratio` you must only define one dimension, either width or height,
otherwise the aspect ratio will be overridden.
