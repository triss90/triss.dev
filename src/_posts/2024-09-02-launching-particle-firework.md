<h1 class="post-transition-end">Launching ParticleFirework.js</h1>

<p class='timestamp'><time datetime='%%date%%'>%%date%%</time></p><hr>

Iâ€™m excited to announce a new addition to the [Webbox](https://webbox.dev/) family: [ParticleFirework.js](https://webbox.dev/particles/) ðŸŽ‰

ParticleFirework.js is a lightweight framework that makes it easy to add dynamic particle effects to your website. Itâ€™s simple to integrate, supports custom SVG particles, and allows you to create everything from subtle backgrounds to eye-catching animations with minimal effort.

Check it out [here](https://webbox.dev/particles/) and see what you can create!
