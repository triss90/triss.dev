This year, I’ve managed to work my way through a mix of genres—sci-fi and speculative fiction were the main events, as always, but I also dipped into some classics, poetry, and even a bit of humor. Some of these books were unforgettable, others a little underwhelming, and a few surprised me in ways I didn’t expect. Here’s the rundown of what kept me turning pages in 2024.

## The Three-Body Problem Series by Liu Cixin

I dove into the *Remembrance of Earth's Past* trilogy this year, partly because Netflix dropped their adaptation in March and partly because the hype was impossible to ignore. And wow—it completely delivered. Liu Cixin blends hard science, deep philosophical questions, and galaxy-spanning stakes into something unforgettable. It’s the kind of series that makes you feel tiny in the grand scheme of things (in the best way). If humanity grappling with alien contact and the vast unknown sounds up your alley, don’t skip this one.

## The Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin

After falling in love with The Left Hand of Darkness a few years ago, I knew I had to pick this up—and it didn’t disappoint. Le Guin is a genius at taking big ideas like freedom, utopia, and responsibility and turning them on their heads. Her writing makes you rethink things you thought you already understood. Plus, her world-building is just chef’s kiss. If you haven’t explored her work yet, seriously, what are you waiting for?

## 1984 and Animal Farm by George Orwell

There’s a reason these are classics. This year, Orwell’s themes of surveillance, propaganda, and power hit me harder than ever—especially 1984, which feels disturbingly relevant right now. It even inspired me to revisit A Gentleman in Moscow, one of my all-time favorites, to think more about resilience in the face of control. These books are timeless for a reason—if they’re still sitting on your to-read list, it’s time to dive in.

## The Rest of My 2024 Reading List
Here’s a quick look at some other books I read this year. Not all of them hit the mark, but they all added something to my year:

- **Shards of Earth** by Adrian Tchaikovsky – Loved his *Children of Time* series, but this one didn’t fully grab me. Maybe I’ll give it another shot in 2025.
- **A Midsummer Night's Dream**, **Hamlet**, and **Romeo and Juliet** by William Shakespeare
- **A Gentleman in Moscow** by Amor Towles
- **The Time Machine**, **The Island of Dr. Moreau**, **The Invisible Man**, and **The War of the Worlds** by H.G. Wells
- **Beyond Good and Evil** by Friedrich Nietzsche
- **The Old Man and the Sea** by Ernest Hemingway – This one wasn’t for me. I might just not vibe with Hemingway’s style.
- **Cunk on Everything** by Philomena Cunk
- **Just Good Manners** by William Hanson
- **Thank you, Jeeves** by P. G. Wodehouse
- **The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy** series by Douglas Adams – Finally read the whole thing! It’s chaotic, hilarious, and full of charm.
- **Help I S\*xted My Boss** by William Hanson & Jordan North – Love their podcast, but the book fell flat for me.
- **Collected Poems of Rudyard Kipling** – A slow burn. I’ll probably keep dipping into this next year.
- **The ABC Murders** by Agatha Christie
- **Starry Messenger: Cosmic Perspectives on Civilization** by Niel deGrasse Tyson
- **The Lion and the Unicorn** by George Orwell
- **Don't Hang Up** by Benjamin Stevenson
- **The Four Horsemen** by Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel C. Dennett, Christopher Hitchens & Stephen Fry
- **Coming Up For Air** by George Orwell – As of writing this, I’m in the middle of it. So far, it’s a fascinating look at nostalgia and the anxieties of a changing world—classic Orwell, but with a lighter touch.

## Wrapping Up My 2024 Reads
Looking back, it’s clear that sci-fi and speculative fiction completely dominated my bookshelf this year—and I wouldn’t have it any other way. These aren’t just stories; they’re a way to grapple with big ideas, ask tough questions, and imagine all kinds of wild possibilities (even the ones that keep you up at night). I’m closing out 2024 feeling inspired and already itching to see what books 2025 has in store.

## Planned Reads for 2025
The list is short for now, but that’s part of the fun—I love seeing where my reading takes me as the year unfolds. Here’s what’s kicking things off:

- **Odyssey** by Stephen Fry – After enjoying *Mythos*, *Heroes*, and *Troy*, Fry’s take on this epic feels like the natural next step. His wit and storytelling are always a treat, and honestly, I might even cheat a little and start this one over Christmas.
- **Farewell to Arms** and **For Whom the Bell Tolls** by Ernest Hemingway – A colleague suggested these as better introductions to Hemingway after *The Old Man and the Sea*. I’m hopeful they’ll give me a new appreciation for his work.  
- **Ernest Cunningham books** (*Everyone in my Family Has Killed Someone*, *Everyone on This Train is a Suspect* & *Everyone this Christmas Has a Secret*) by Benjamin Stevenson – My wife swears by these, calling them both hilarious and packed with exciting twists. Her recommendations rarely miss, so I’m excited to give them a shot.
